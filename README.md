# Encryption examples
The goal of this repository is to have a collection of encryption examples.


To help in the "Cryptography" section of the National cyber League, I collected the answers of the TryHackMe CTF "CTF collection Vol.1" (https://tryhackme.com/room/ctfcollectionvol1) in this repository. You can see the name of the encryption type and how it looks.

Also, this is a good source to look how a encryption looks like:

And finally this is a good website to decode to:

## Base 64

`VEhNe2p1NTdfZDNjMGQzXzdoM19iNDUzfQ==`

## Base 58

`3agrSy1CewF9v8ukcSkPSYm3oKUoByUpKG4L`

## ROT13

`MAF{atbe_max_vtxltk}`

## Binaryfuck

`'++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>>++++++++++++++.----------`

## S1 XOR S2

`S1: 44585d6b2368737c65252166234f20626d
S2: 1010101010101010101010101010101010`

## Vigenere Cipher and Caesar Cipher

`MYKAHODTQ{RVG_YVGGK_FAL_WXF}`

Both of this encryption types looks very similar, but Caesar Cipher requires a key

## Dec to Hex to Ascii

This last one is tricky because you need to do two kinds of decoding. First you need to pass it to hex and then to ascii.

If you know more types of encryptions and you recognize it better, you can discover more flags.
